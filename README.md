# Dynamic OverCloud

## Overview ##
Dynamic OverCloud is a specially-arranged razor-thin overlay layer that supports the open-source leveraged service composition in a cloud-agnostic way. Dynamic OverCloud includes several elements to support the MSA-based service composition. Dynamic OverCloud consists of Interface Proxy, Dev+Ops Post, Cloud-native Clusters, Connected DataLake and Visible Fabric. Dynamic OverCloud provides the open-source leveraged service composition when given a containerized microservices pattern that corresponds to the targeted service.
